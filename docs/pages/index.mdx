<FAQBox title="Alpernative Tree support React 18?">Yes, AlperNative Tree supports React 18</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="AlperNative Tree support Virtualization?">
    Yes, AlperNative Tree supports virtualization. It uses the
    [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) and [react-virtualized-auto-sizer](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized-auto-sizer) library to render large lists. If you want to use virtualization, you can add props like `virtualItemHeight` and `isVirtualizationEnabled` to the `Tree` component.

<FAQBox title="AlperNative Tree support Support DnD?">
  Yes, AlperNative Tree supports drag and drop. It uses the [@hello-pangea/dnd](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd)
  library to support drag and drop. The [@hello-pangea/dnd](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd) library is a
  continuation of Atlassian's [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) library, which has
  announced that it will no longer be supported. Normally,
  [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) does not support React 18, which is why
  [@hello-pangea/dnd](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd) is being used instead. In the AlperNative Tree, the
  [@hello-pangea/dnd](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd) library is utilized as the drag-and-drop (DnD) library. If
  you want to use DnD, you can add props like `isDragEnabled` to the `Tree` component.
